Video Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering

Data Preprocessing:
-------------------
- Removed entries with missing video IDs or channel titles.
- Generated a user-video interaction matrix.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
--------------------------
- Identified the top 10 channels with the most videos. 
  (This data is visualized in the Python script using a bar chart.)

Model Building:
---------------
- Used Collaborative Filtering with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- Split the data into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%).

Model Evaluation:
-----------------
- Evaluated the model using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  (Note: Actual RMSE value can be obtained by running the provided Python script.)
